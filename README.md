# Twitch-Popularity-Turned-Profitability 

This project explores the relationship between Twitchâ€™s specific video game categories and the popularity of each category. This relationship relies on the assumption that Twitch popularity indicates profitability for a game. With this in mind, the paper provides insights to video game developers on directions for future game production as well as marketing strategies. The relationship between game categories and Twitch popularity is investigated using key qualitative (e.g. game genre, game title etc.) and quantitative (e.g. average total views per category, average total watch time per category, etc.) variables from Twitch API datasets on SullyGnome (SullyGnome, 2021) that can be used to define popularity. Through the use of an analysis of variance, linear regressions, and data visualisations of trends, the null hypothesis was rejected.  #### Ha. There is a positive relationship between First-Person Shooter(FPS)/Shooter games and watch time and viewer count.  #### Ho. There is no relationship between First-Person Shooter(FPS)/Shooter games and watch time and viewer count.  The paper finds evidence that FPS games do result in higher view counts and watch time than other game genres; ultimately, suggesting that the FPS genre does lend itself to higher sales revenue for the game developers.
